# Neural-Networks
This repository is used to study the architecture of neural networks in the topic of artificial intelligience and deep learning. I will specifically try to build neural network projects from scratch without any libraries to really have a deep understanding of its application. 
My background in this field is very limited. I have only watched the three-blue-one-brown deep learning videos on YouTube, and some what have a superficial understanding of the goal of neural networks and what it is trying to accomplish. By makiing this repo public, I hope that other people can be inspired to learn this technology, even without much training. My goal is to document everything as much as possible and leave any content that was beneficial for my learning for the benefit of all.
